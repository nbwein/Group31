Playscription codes are a 5 digit number. The first 2 digits correspond to the activity type, 2 digits after that correspond to the duration of the activity (in minutes) and the last digit of the code corresponds to the frequency (how many days per week) of the activity.

As of now, the codes for each activity type (the first 2 digits of the playscription code) are mapped as follows:
01 -> Running  
02 -> Playing sports  
03 -> Swimming  
04 -> Playing on the playground  
05 -> Playing basketball  
06 -> Playing football  
07 -> Playing soccer  
08 -> Playing baseball  
09 -> Go for a walk  
10 -> Go biking  

Any other combination of first 2 digits other than these 10 will not go through and will prompt the user for a valid playscription code.

When entering a Playscription code, the system will only look at the Playscription code if it is exactly 5 digits.  If it is not 5 digits, it will look at the manual entries for that page.
